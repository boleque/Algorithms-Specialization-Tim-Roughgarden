Balanced Search Trees:
Idea - ensure that hight always log(n)
Example: red-black trees, AVL trees, splay trees, B trees;

RB trees maintains invariants to stay balanced
Red-Black Invariants:
---cosmetic---
1. Each node red or black;
2. Root is always black;
---main---
3. no 2 reds in a row (red node -> black children);
4. every path to root-null path has same number of black nodes;
